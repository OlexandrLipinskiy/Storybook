# Welcome to project

Storybook helps to build UI components in isolation from app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. It is possible to save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

# About license

The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1980s.
As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.
